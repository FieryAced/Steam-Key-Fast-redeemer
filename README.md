Takes a single command-line argument to find a text file that contains steam keys somewhere in the file and opens a link to steam in your default browser to redeem. Does this for all steam keys found.

Instructions:

1. This program is intended to be used via command line/console
2. It requires the file path (or name if file is already in same folder as program) as the first argument
3. This program then will find every key in the file and open a window that has the key pasted into the redemption code box
4. Press activate and close the tab/window.
